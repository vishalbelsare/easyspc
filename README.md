# Sparse principal components analysis based on SVD.
This package implements the sparse principal components algorithm developed by Shen and Huang and explained in [this paper]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X07000887).

This implementation is faster and easier than the one proposed in [Scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.SparsePCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.SparsePCA). Please check the [post on my blog](https://smartparrot.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/spca/) if you want more information about this method. There is also a Jupyter notebook file that shows how SPCA can be used on images to detect objects of interest.
