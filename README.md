# Sparse principal components analysis based on SVD.
## Content
This package implements the sparse principal components algorithm developed by Shen and Huang and explained in [this paper]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X07000887).

This implementation is faster and easier than the one proposed in [Scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.SparsePCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.SparsePCA). Please check the [post on my blog](https://smartparrot.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/spca/) if you want more information about this method. There is also a Jupyter notebook file that shows how SPCA can be used on images to detect objects of interest.

##Getting started
Besides a recent version of Numpy, the PyWavelets package is required in order to perform thresholding operations
###Prerequisites
```
pip install PyWavelets
```

### Installing

To install spc-svd you can just use pip

```
pip install spc-svd
```
## Example


### Computation of SVD and low rank approximation


```
